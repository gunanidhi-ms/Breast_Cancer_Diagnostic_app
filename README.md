🩺 Breast Cancer Diagnostic App

This project is a basic machine learning application that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using a Logistic Regression model. The goal of this project was to practice data analysis, machine learning fundamentals, and dashboard building while working on a real-world dataset.

📊 Project Overview

The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

Data was preprocessed by handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and scaling features using StandardScaler.

A Logistic Regression classifier was implemented to perform binary classification of tumors.

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.

🖥️ Interactive Dashboard

To make the project more engaging, an interactive Streamlit app was developed.
The dashboard allows users to:

Input cell nuclei measurements via sliders in the sidebar.

Visualize the selected inputs on a radar chart built with Plotly.

Generate predictions (benign/malignant) along with probability scores.

View results in a simple and clear interface.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python: Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing and analysis

Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression model, scaling, evaluation

Streamlit: Interactive web app interface

Plotly: Radar chart visualization

🎯 Key Learning

This is a beginner-friendly project focused on applying basic machine learning concepts in practice. It helped me understand:

The workflow of a machine learning project (data → model → evaluation → deployment).

How to preprocess data and train a simple classification model.

How to build dashboards to make machine learning models more interactive and user-friendly.
